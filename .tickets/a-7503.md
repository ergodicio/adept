# Phase 8: Testing and validation

Comprehensive testing of multi-species implementation with physics validation.

## Unit Tests

1. **Pusher q/m scaling**: Verify qm_ratio scaling works correctly
2. **Charge density summation**: Two species with q=-1, q=+1 should cancel
3. **Configuration parsing**: New schema validation, backward compatibility
4. **Grid independence**: Species with different nv work correctly

## Integration Tests

1. **Two-stream instability (backward compat)**:
   - Two electron beams using existing twostream.yaml
   - Compare with/without multi-species implementation
   - Should get identical results

2. **Stationary ions**:
   - Electrons + heavy stationary ions (m_i/m_e=1836, v0=0)
   - Should match single-species electron results

3. **Ion acoustic wave**:
   - Cold ions + hot electrons, sinusoidal perturbation
   - Measure oscillation frequency from E field
   - Compare to theory: ω_ia ≈ k·c_s where c_s = sqrt(T_e/m_i)

4. **Landau damping with ions**:
   - Maxwellian electrons + ions, density perturbation
   - Measure damping rate γ
   - Compare to theoretical prediction

5. **Electron-ion two-stream**:
   - Drifting electrons + drifting ions
   - Verify growth rate matches theory

## Files
- `tests/` directory
- New test configs in `configs/vlasov-1d/`

## Acceptance Criteria
- All unit tests pass
- Backward compatibility validated (existing tests unchanged)
- At least 3 physics validation tests pass
- Growth rates / frequencies within 10% of theory
