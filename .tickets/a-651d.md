# Phase 3: Update pushers for multi-species with dict architecture

Modify Vlasov pushers to operate on dicts of distributions internally, with species-specific grids and q/m ratios.

## Design

Pushers now receive `f_dict` and loop internally over species. Each pusher needs access to species-specific grid parameters.

**VelocityExponential:**
- Constructor: `__init__(species_grids, species_params)`
- Call signature: `__call__(f_dict, e, dt)` → returns `f_dict`
- Loops over species, applies `exp(-i*kv_s*dt*qm_s*e)` with species-specific kv

**VelocityCubicSpline:**
- Constructor: `__init__(species_grids, species_params)`
- Call signature: `__call__(f_dict, e, dt)` → returns `f_dict`
- Creates per-species interpolators with species-specific v grids
- Computes `vq = v_s - qm_s*e*dt` for each species

**SpaceExponential:**
- Constructor: `__init__(x, species_grids)`
- Call signature: `__call__(f_dict, dt)` → returns `f_dict`
- Loops over species, applies `exp(-i*kx*dt*v_s)` with species-specific v

## Files
- `adept/_vlasov1d/solvers/pushers/vlasov.py`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pushers handle dict input/output correctly
- Species-specific velocity grids used correctly
- q/m ratios applied correctly in velocity pushers
- Unit test: verify qm scaling works as expected
