# Implement multi-species collision handling

Currently, the Fokker-Planck collision operator only applies to the electron distribution (fokker_planck.py:56-68). For multi-species simulations, we need proper collision handling between different species.

## Tasks

- Design collision operator interface for multi-species
- Implement inter-species collisions (e.g., electron-ion, ion-ion)
- Update Fokker-Planck operator to handle multiple species
- Handle Krook operator for multiple species
- Add tests for multi-species collision physics

## Notes

Current implementation passes non-electron species through unchanged. This is acceptable for single-ion-species simulations where we only track electrons, but will need proper physics for true multi-species runs.

Related to multi-species support implementation. Issue identified during code review (fokker_planck.py:56).
