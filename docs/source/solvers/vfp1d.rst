Implicit Cartesian-Spherical Harmonics Vlasov-Fokker-Planck in 1D3V
=====================================================================

This set of solvers is usually used to model electron transport over hydrodynamic / collisional time-scales while the other Vlasov solvers in ``ADEPT`` are for 
modeling over electron plasma wave time-scales.
