"""
Fokker-Planck relaxation test framework (shared infrastructure).

This package provides helpers, initial conditions, metrics, and runner logic
for FP relaxation tests. It is NOT a test directory itself -- actual test files
live in tests/test_vlasov1d/ (cartesian) and tests/test_vfp1d/ (spherical).
